# What is the ProtoSwitchBoard?

Does all your electronics prototypes end up looking like a snake nest? Are you forced to trace each cable to reverse engineer your own prototypes after getting back from a coffee break? The ProtoSwicthBoard is a labeled interconnect for your project designed to make your experimental prototypes as easy to follow as your circuit diagram!

It is especially suited for projects utilizing some kind of bus (i2c, spi etc) where multiple units share connections. Below is a picture of an experimental setup with an ADF signal generator hooked up to an arduino over spi, and a logic analyzer to debug the protocol. It is using an early prototype of the ProtoSwitchBoard:

# Features
* 10 labeled sets of jumper headers
* 5 male and 5 female jumper headers in each set
* Label paper can be switched easily

# Paper
The labels on the ProtoSwitchBoard are written on ordinary paper placed inside the device. The paper size is the standard one used for business cards (3.5" x 2"), which means that you can order it, with or without pre-printed labels, from any online bussiness card printing service. You can of course also just cut some ordinary paper to size with a pair of cissors!

# Where can I get one
[Our KickStarter Campaign (ended!)](https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/innovationgarage/make-100-protoswitchboard)

# How can I make one?
Head over to [github](https://github.com/innovationgarage/ProtoSwitchBoard) and download the design sketches and production guides. Making your own requires a 3d printer and intermediate soldering skills.
